# Security & Privacy Documentation

## 🛡️ Privacy-First Design

This trauma response chatbot is designed with **absolute privacy and security** as the top priority.

### Core Security Principles

1. **Zero External Data Transmission**
   - No user data leaves the user's device
   - No API calls to external services
   - No third-party processing of trauma content

2. **Client-Side Processing Only**
   - All NLP processing happens locally in the browser
   - No server-side processing of sensitive content
   - Session storage only - data is cleared when browser closes

3. **No LLM Integration**
   - Deliberately avoids external LLM services
   - Prevents data exposure to third-party providers
   - Maintains complete user anonymity

## 🔒 Security Measures Implemented

### Input Sanitization
- Removes script tags and dangerous content
- Strips event handlers and malicious patterns
- Prevents XSS and injection attacks

### Secure Logging
- No sensitive user content is logged
- Only metadata (confidence scores, field counts) is recorded
- User names, trauma details, and personal information are never logged

### Data Handling
- Form data stored only in browser session storage
- No persistent storage on servers
- Data automatically cleared when session ends

### Network Security
- No external API calls
- No data transmission to third parties
- HTTPS-only communication (when deployed)

## 🚫 What We DON'T Do

- ❌ Send trauma content to external services
- ❌ Store user data on servers
- ❌ Use LLM APIs that could expose sensitive information
- ❌ Log personal details or trauma narratives
- ❌ Share data with third-party providers
- ❌ Use analytics that track user behavior

## ✅ What We DO

- ✅ Process all content locally
- ✅ Maintain complete user anonymity
- ✅ Provide trauma-sensitive responses
- ✅ Extract form data securely
- ✅ Support users without compromising privacy
- ✅ Follow GDPR and privacy best practices

## 🔍 Privacy Compliance

### GDPR Compliance
- **Right to be Forgotten**: Data automatically cleared when browser closes
- **Data Minimization**: Only essential data is processed
- **Purpose Limitation**: Data used only for form completion
- **Transparency**: Clear documentation of data handling

### Trauma-Sensitive Design
- No permanent record of trauma narratives
- Immediate data deletion when session ends
- No profiling or tracking of users
- Respect for user autonomy and control

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Secure NLP Pipeline
```typescript
// All processing happens locally
const nlpPipeline = SecureNLPPipeline.getInstance()
const processed = await nlpPipeline.processInput(userInput)
// No external calls, no data transmission
```

### Session Storage Only
```typescript
// Data exists only in browser session
SessionStorage.saveSessionData(formData)
// Automatically cleared when browser closes
```

### Secure Logging
```typescript
// Only log metadata, never user content
console.log('Processing confidence:', confidence)
// Never: console.log('User said:', userInput)
```

## 🚨 Security Considerations for Deployment

1. **HTTPS Required**: Always deploy with SSL/TLS encryption
2. **No Analytics**: Avoid tracking services that could capture user data
3. **Server Logs**: Ensure server logs don't capture sensitive content
4. **CDN Security**: Use privacy-focused CDNs if needed
5. **Regular Audits**: Review code for any potential data leaks

## 📞 Support & Reporting

If you discover any security or privacy concerns:
1. Review the code for potential issues
2. Test the application for data leaks
3. Ensure no external services are being called
4. Verify that sensitive content is not being logged

## 🔄 Future Considerations

If LLM integration is ever considered:
1. **Local LLM Only**: Use models that run entirely on user's device
2. **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Ensure no data leaves user control
3. **Explicit Consent**: Clear opt-in for any external processing
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete transparency about data handling
